# P5ts With Classes - Starter Project

This allows you to start with a very simple project that has two classes (imported as es6 modules) and a p5js script on the index page.

All code is in the 'project' directory. Do not edit anything in the 'project/js' directory, as that is automatically generated by typescript.

All dependencies have been included, so you shouldn't even need to run `npm install` but if something doesn't work, try that.

## To run your code

Remember, your code won't run unless you convert it to typescript! I suggest that you look for the "tsc watch" command in the `Terminal->Run Task` menu and run it at the beginning of every coding session. It should automatically convert your typescript to javascript as you work. You can also run "tsc build" from that same menu to do the conversion just one time.
